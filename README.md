# Crazy Cattle 3D iOS

[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/crazy-cattle-3d/id6745103347)

This is the **iOS port** of [Crazy Cattle 3D](https://4nn4t4t.itch.io/crazycattle3d), a chaotic physics-based battle royale game where sheep battle in farms. This version is built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) with mobile support and optimized controls for touchscreen devices.

Why i made this:
my friend (def not brainrotted) showed me this game and begged me to play.
seeing the 10fps performance and n64 ahh graphics i was like hell nah -- but bro would not shut up about it.
later he asked me to port it to appstore, but i didnt because i thought "who tf would play ts"
but he told me its really popular rn and i thought i could use it for shipwrecked

so here is my attempt

i wanted to fix the lag, and add touchscreen support
basically most ppl play the game on their school chromebooks off some dodgy unblocked games site, so performance was an issue
iphones and ipads these days have hella good gpus so why not take advantage of them
the port does that and also add touchscreen support
